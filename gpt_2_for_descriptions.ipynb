In Fish, players control one fish.  By using your favorite fish and fishing techniques, you can catch lots of fish. You don’t have to do too much work though, it’s just your fish.  Fishing is done in a very relaxing way.  Fish are very friendly, quick to learn, and the more you practice, the better your catches are. And all the while the fish stays in the water for long (around 10-12 hours).<br><br>Players can choose several fish.  Different types of fish:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Chicken</strong> - A well known type of fish, like chicken bones, chicken bellies and chicken feet.  <br></li><li><strong>Cockle</strong> - A smaller type of fish, that lives in the bottom. <br></li><li><strong>Sea Fox</strong> - Larger fish and is better at catching and eating fish. This can create a lot of stress and frustration for your fish.
